```

### Sending Commands

#### Command Format
Commands are sent to the `microscope/stage/command` topic using the format:
```
<COMMAND>/<AXIS>/<PARAMETER>
```

#### Movement Commands
```bash
# Move X axis to position 5000 nm
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "microscope/stage/command" -m "MOVE/X/5000"

# Move Y axis to position -2500 nm  
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "microscope/stage/command" -m "MOVE/Y/-2500"

# Move Z axis to position 10000 nm
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "microscope/stage/command" -m "MOVE/Z/10000"

# Move R axis to 90 degrees (90000 micro-degrees)
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "microscope/stage/command" -m "MOVE/R/90000"
```

#### Stop Commands
```bash
# Stop X axis movement (disable closed-loop control)
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "microscope/stage/command" -m "STOP/X"

# Stop all axes (send individual stop commands)
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "microscope/stage/command" -m "STOP/X"
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "microscope/stage/command" -m "STOP/Y"
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "microscope/stage/command" -m "STOP/Z"
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "microscope/stage/command" -m "STOP/R"
```

**STOP Command Behavior:**
- **Disables closed-loop movement control** - stops active positioning
- **Maintains output stage** - keeps axis powered and ready
- **Immediate effect** - stops movement instantly
- **Safe operation** - can resume movement with new MOVE commands

#### System Status Command
```bash
# Get detailed system status (equivalent to "ecc_tool list")
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "microscope/stage/command" -m "STATUS"
```

**STATUS Command Output:**
The STATUS command generates a comprehensive system report published to the result topic, including:
- MQTT and controller connection status
- Firmware versions and controller IDs
- Current positions for all axes with correct logical names (X, Y, Z, R)
- Performance statistics (actual frequency, missed deadlines)
- Amplitude, frequency, and target range settings
- Movement status, reference status, and error conditions
- EOT (End of Travel) status
- Output enable status
- Active system errors

### Monitoring Data

#### Position Stream
Monitor real-time position data at 10kHz:
```bash
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "microscope/stage/position"
```

**Data Format:**
```
timestamp_picoseconds/X_position/Y_position/Z_position/R_position
1735689123456789000/999730/-92564/-224330/-600530
1735689123457789000/999730/-92564/-224330/-600530
```

#### Command Results and Errors
Monitor command execution results and system errors:
```bash
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "microscope/stage/result"
```

**Command Result Format:**
```
timestamp_ps/COMMAND/command_id/axis/SUCCESS_or_FAILED/optional_error_message
1735689123456789000/COMMAND/1735689123456789000/X/SUCCESS
1735689123457789000/COMMAND/1735689123457789000/Y/FAILED/Axis not connected
```

**Error Format:**
```
timestamp_ps/ERROR/error_type/axis_or_system/severity/description
1735689123456789000/ERROR/EOT_FORWARD/X/CRITICAL/End of travel detected on X
1735689123457789000/ERROR/MQTT_DISCONNECTED/SYSTEM/ERROR/MQTT broker connection lost
```

#### System Status
Monitor system status changes:
```bash
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "microscope/stage/status"
```

**Status Messages:**
- `SYSTEM_READY` - System initialized and ready
- `SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN` - System shutting down

## Architecture

### Multi-Threaded Design

The system uses three main threads for optimal performance:

1. **Position Publisher Thread** (10kHz)
   - Continuously samples all axis positions using controller ID-based lookup
   - Publishes position data via MQTT with picosecond timestamps
   - Maintains precise timing intervals with performance monitoring

2. **Command Receiver Thread** (High Responsiveness)
   - Processes incoming MQTT commands
   - Executes movement and stop commands using ID-based controller mapping
   - Reports command results and failures

3. **Error Monitor Thread** (20Hz)
   - Monitors hardware error conditions
   - Checks for end-of-travel (EOT) conditions
   - Performs emergency stops when needed  
   - Monitors controller and MQTT connectivity

### Controller ID-Based Mapping

The system uses controller IDs rather than connection order for reliable operation:
- **find_controller_by_id()** locates controllers by their internal ID
- **get_controller_axis_from_name()** maps logical axis names (X, Y, Z, R) to physical controller/axis
- **Plug-and-play operation** - works regardless of USB connection order
- **Clear error messages** when expected controllers are missing

### Safety Features

#### Automatic Emergency Stops
The system automatically stops movement when:
- **Hardware errors** detected on any axis
- **End of travel (EOT)** conditions reached
- **Controller disconnection** detected
- **Command execution exceptions** occur

#### Pre-flight Safety Checks
Before executing movement commands:
- Verify controller and axis connectivity using ID-based lookup
- Check for existing hardware errors
- Validate EOT status
- Confirm axis is operational

#### Error Reporting
All errors are:
- Logged to console with severity levels
- Published to MQTT result topic with proper axis identification
- Stored in internal error tracking system
- Timestamped with picosecond precision

## Performance Specifications

### Timing Performance
- **Position Sampling**: Up to 10,000 Hz (0.1ms intervals)
- **Command Response**: < 1ms typical
- **Error Monitoring**: 20 Hz (50ms intervals)
- **Timestamp Precision**: Picoseconds (1e-12 seconds)

### Data Throughput
- **Position Stream**: ~2KB/second at 10kHz
- **MQTT Overhead**: Minimal with QoS 0 for positions, QoS 1 for commands
- **Network Usage**: ~5KB/second typical

### System Resources
- **CPU Usage**: ~10-20% on modern systems at 10kHz
- **Memory**: < 50MB typical
- **Network**: Low bandwidth requirements

### Performance Verification

Check actual performance using the STATUS command:
```bash
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "microscope/stage/command" -m "STATUS"
```

Look for these metrics in the response:
- **Sample Rate**: Configured rate (e.g., 10000 Hz)
- **Actual Frequency**: Measured rate (should be within ±0.1% of sample rate)
- **Total Samples**: Number of position samples taken
- **Missed Deadlines**: Count of timing violations (should be < 0.1%)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Wrong Controller Detected
```bash
# Check controller IDs with ecc_tool
./ecc_tool list

# Look for:
# Controller 0 (ID=4, Handle=1)  <- Should be XYZ
# Controller 1 (ID=2222, Handle=2) <- Should be R
```

If IDs don't match, update the constants in the code:
```cpp
const int XYZ_CONTROLLER_ID = 4;     // Update if different
const int R_CONTROLLER_ID = 2222;    // Update if different
```

#### 2. Axis Mapping Issues
The system expects:
- **Controller ID=4**: Y=axis0, X=axis1, Z=axis2
- **Controller ID=2222**: R=axis0

If your hardware has different mapping, update the `get_axis_name()` and related functions.

#### 3. Performance Issues
```bash
# Check actual frequency with STATUS command
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "microscope/stage/command" -m "STATUS"

# Monitor system load
htop -p $(pgrep ecc_mqtt_streaming)

# Check for USB issues
dmesg | grep -i usb
```

#### 4. Compilation Errors
```bash
# Missing MQTT library
sudo apt-get install libmosquitto-dev

# Missing ECC100 library
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
sudo ldconfig
```

#### 5. MQTT Connection Issues
```bash
# Check if broker is running
sudo systemctl status mosquitto

# Start broker if stopped
sudo systemctl start mosquitto

# Test broker connectivity
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "test" -m "hello"
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "test"
```

#### 6. Controller Connection Issues
```bash
# Check if controllers are detected
./ecc_tool list

# Verify USB/Ethernet connections
lsusb  # For USB controllers
ip addr  # For Ethernet controllers

# Check permissions
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
# Log out and back in for changes to take effect
```

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging by adding debug output to the source code:

```cpp
// Add this near the top of functions for debugging
{
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(g_console_mutex);
    std::cout << "DEBUG: Function_name - status info\n";
}
```

### Monitoring Tools

#### Real-time Position Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor with timestamps
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "microscope/stage/position" -F "%I [%t] %p"

# Count messages to verify frequency
timeout 10s mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "microscope/stage/position" | wc -l
# Should show ~100,000 for 10kHz over 10 seconds
```

#### System Health Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor all system topics
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "microscope/stage/+" -v

# Monitor only errors
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "microscope/stage/result" | grep ERROR
```

## Integration Examples

### MATLAB Integration

```matlab
% MATLAB MQTT Stage Control Example
function stage_controller()
    % Create MQTT client
    broker = "localhost";
    port = 1883;
    client = mqttclient(broker, Port=port);
    
    % Subscribe to position topic
    subscribe(client, "microscope/stage/position", @positionCallback);
    subscribe(client, "microscope/stage/result", @resultCallback);
    
    % Move X axis to 1000 nm
    moveAxis(client, "X", 1000);
    
    % Wait for movement
    pause(3);
    
    % Stop X axis
    stopAxis(client, "X");
    
    % Get system status
    getSystemStatus(client);
    
    % Keep running for a while
    pause(10);
end

function moveAxis(client, axis, position)
    command = sprintf("MOVE/%s/%d", axis, position);
    write(client, "microscope/stage/command", command);
    fprintf("Sent command: %s\n", command);
end

function stopAxis(client, axis)
    command = sprintf("STOP/%s", axis);
    write(client, "microscope/stage/command", command);
    fprintf("Sent stop command: %s\n", command);
end

function getSystemStatus(client)
    command = "STATUS";
    write(client, "microscope/stage/command", command);
    fprintf("Sent status command: %s\n", command);
    fprintf("Check result topic for detailed status report\n");
end

function positionCallback(topic, message)
    % Parse position data: timestamp/X/Y/Z/R
    data = split(message, "/");
    if length(data) == 5
        fprintf("Position - X:%s Y:%s Z:%s R:%s\n", ...
                data{2}, data{3}, data{4}, data{5});
    end
end

function resultCallback(topic, message)
    fprintf("Result: %s\n", message);
end
```

## Advanced Configuration

### High-Speed Operation

For applications requiring higher sampling rates:

```cpp
// Increase sampling rate (tested up to 10kHz)
const int SAMPLE_RATE_HZ = 10000;  // 10kHz sampling

// For even higher rates, consider system optimization:
// - Real-time kernel (PREEMPT_RT)
// - CPU isolation
// - Process priority adjustment
```

### Remote MQTT Broker

```cpp
// Connect to remote broker
const std::string MQTT_BROKER = "192.168.1.100";  // Remote broker IP
const int MQTT_PORT = 1883;

// For secure connections (requires additional setup)
const int MQTT_PORT = 8883;  // TLS/SSL port
```

### Custom Topic Structure

```cpp
// Customize MQTT topics for your application
const std::string MQTT_TOPIC_POSITION = "lab/microscope1/stage/position";
const std::string MQTT_TOPIC_COMMAND = "lab/microscope1/stage/command";
const std::string MQTT_TOPIC_RESULT = "lab/microscope1/stage/result";
const std::string MQTT_TOPIC_STATUS = "lab/microscope1/stage/status";
```

## Safety Guidelines

### Operational Safety
1. **Always verify controller IDs** before operation using STATUS command
2. **Monitor EOT status** - system will auto-stop but verify manually
3. **Use reasonable movement speeds** - system doesn't control velocity directly
4. **Test with small movements** before large positioning operations
5. **Keep emergency stop accessible** - Ctrl+C stops the entire system

### System Safety
1. **Monitor MQTT connectivity** - loss of connection may isolate system
2. **Check error logs regularly** - watch the result topic for issues
3. **Verify controller connections** before critical operations using STATUS command
4. **Backup position data** if needed for critical applications
5. **Test recovery procedures** - practice restarting after errors

### Data Safety
1. **Position timestamps are in picoseconds** - handle large numbers appropriately
2. **NaN values indicate invalid readings** - check before using position data
3. **Commands are executed immediately** - no undo functionality
4. **System state is not persistent** - positions reset on restart

## Support and Maintenance

### Log Files
The system outputs all information to stdout/stderr. To log to files:

```bash
# Run with logging
./ecc_mqtt_streaming 2>&1 | tee ecc_mqtt_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log

# Run in background with logging
nohup ./ecc_mqtt_streaming > ecc_mqtt.log 2>&1 &
```

### System Monitoring
Create a systemd service for automatic startup:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/ecc-mqtt.service
[Unit]
Description=ECC100 MQTT Streaming Control
After=network.target mosquitto.service

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your_username
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/ecc/directory
ExecStart=/path/to/ecc/directory/ecc_mqtt_streaming
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
# Enable and start service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable ecc-mqtt.service
sudo systemctl start ecc-mqtt.service

# Monitor service
sudo systemctl status ecc-mqtt.service
sudo journalctl -u ecc-mqtt.service -f
```

### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor system resources
top -p $(pgrep ecc_mqtt_streaming)

# Monitor network usage
sudo netstat -i  # Interface statistics
sudo ss -tuln    # Network connections

# Monitor MQTT traffic
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t '$SYS/broker/messages/received/1min'
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t '$SYS/broker/messages/sent/1min'
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Maximum 2 controllers** - hardcoded limit in current implementation
2. **Sequential command execution** - commands processed one at a time
3. **No position history** - only current positions maintained
4. **No configuration persistence** - settings not saved to file
5. **Linux only** - Windows port would require significant changes
6. **No built-in safety limits** - relies on hardware EOT detection
7. **No velocity control** - position-only control mode
8. **Controller ID dependency** - requires specific controller IDs (4 and 2222)

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for future versions:
- **Configurable controller IDs** via configuration file
- **Web interface** for browser-based control
- **Position history logging** with SQLite database
- **Multi-axis coordinated movements** 
- **Safety limit enforcement** in software
- **Windows compatibility** layer
- **REST API** in addition to MQTT
- **Real-time plotting** capabilities
- **Auto-recovery mechanisms** for connection failures
- **Dynamic controller discovery** without hardcoded IDs
